# hp-fem on an L-shaped domain

This example computes the solution of the following BVP with hp-fem.

```
div(grad(u)) = 0                              on \Omega
u(r,theta)   = r^(2/3)*sin(2/3*(theta+pi/2))  on boundary of \Omega
```
where \Omega is the L-shaped domain [-1,1]^2 \ [-1,0]^2 and `r` and `theta`
denote radial coordinates.

The solution of this BVP is
```
u(r,theta) = r^(2/3)*sin(2/3*(theta+pi/2))
```

Note that the gradient of the solution blows up as r -> 0.
Therefore we grade/refine the mesh towards the singularity at the origin to obtain more accurate solutions.

The hp-approximation space of level `L` is defined as follows:
1) The base mesh is refined `L` times at the origin.
2) The polynomial degree of all cells adjacent to the origin is fixed with p=1 and increases from there linearly up to `L+1`
(see also the .vtk file generated by the example).
   The polynomial degree of an edge is always the minimum of the two degrees of the adjacent elements.

With this setup we can obtain *exponential convergence*, that is the error behaves as `O(e^(-b*p))` or `O(e^(-b*sqrt(N)))`
where `p` denotes the maximal polynomial degree, `N` the number of dofs and `b` is a positive constant independent of `p`/`N`.
