# LehrFEM++ demo codes for Chapter 3.2.3 of the Course "Numerical Methods for PDEs"

The codes in this folder correspond to the convergence studies performed in Section 3.2.3 of the "Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations" lecture notes. All the plots therein can be generated by this folders contents and the additional codes in the NPDECODES repository containing more codes associtated with the lecture.

All plots generated by the Python scripts located in this folder are also saved here.


## Linear and Quadratic Lagrangian FE

This example found in the file `linquadlagrfe.cc` performs the experiments 3.2.3.7 and 3.2.3.8 from the lecture nodes. A manufactured solution convergence study is performed on a square domain using Linear and Quadratic Lagrangian FEM. The H1 and L2 error norms of the two methods are compared. The makefile target `examples.lecturedemos.convergencestudies.linquadlagrfe_run` can be used to generate the corresponding plots. In total, four plots are generated:
- `Q_H1_dofs.eps`: Log-log plot of the H1 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the number of DOFs
- `Q_H1_meshwidth.eps`: Log-log plot of the H1 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the mesh width
- `Q_L2_dofs.eps`: Log-log plot of the L2 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the number of DOFs
- `Q_L2_meshwidth.eps`: Log-log plot of the L2 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the mesh width


## Convergence on L-Shaped Domain

This example found in the file `linquadfelshaped.cc` performs the experiment 3.2.3.10 from the lecture nodes. A h-convergence analysis is performed on an L-shaped domain to demonstrate the impact of singularities on the convergence. The makefile target `examples.lecturedemos.convergencestudies.linquadfelshaped_run` can be used to generate the corresponding plots. In total, two plots are generated:
- `L_H1_dofs.eps`: Log-log plot of the H1 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the number of DOFs
- `L_H1_meshwidth.eps`: Log-log plot of the H1 error norm for linear and quadratic lagrangian FE against the mesh width


## p-Refinement

This example found in the file `prefinement.cc` performs the experiment 3.2.3.11 from the lecture nodes. The convergence rate of p-FEM is demonstrated by solving a simple PDE on a square domain and on an L-shaped domain. The makefile target `examples.lecturedemos.convergencestudies.prefinement_run` can be used to generate the corresponding plots. In total, four plots are generated:
- `LShape_degPoly.eps`: H1 and L2 error norms for the L-shaped domain plotted against the polynomial degree of the basis functions
- `LShape_N.eps`: H1 and L2 error norms for the L-shaped domain plotted against the number of DOFs
- `Square_degPoly.eps`: H1 and L2 error norms for the square domain plotted against the polynomial degree of the basis functions
- `Square_N.eps`: H1 and L2 error norms for the square domain plotted against the number of DOFs
