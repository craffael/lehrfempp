   * @brief Construction of mesh from information gathered in a MeshFactory
   * @param dim_world Dimension of the ambient space.
   * @param nodes sequential container of node coordinates
   * @param edges sequential container of pairs of
   *               (i) vectors of indices of the nodes of an edge
   *               (ii) pointers to the geometry object describing an edge
   * @param cells sequential container of pairs of
   *               (i) vectors of indices of the nodes of a cell
   *               (ii) pointers to the geometry object for the cell
   * @param check_completeness If set to true, the constructor will check that
   * the mesh is topologically complete. That means that every entity with
   * codimension `codim>0` is a subentity of at least one entity with
   * codimension `codim-1`. If `check_completeness = true` and the mesh is not
   * complete, an assert will fail.
   *
   * ### Shape guessing
   *
   * Shape information usually supplied by a unique pointer to a
   * lf::geometry::Geometry object attached to an entity may be missing for some
   * of the entities. In this case the constructor tries to reconstruct the
   * shape from that of other entities.
   *
   * The main example is missing geometry information for nodes or edges. In
   * this case a call to the lf::geometry::SubGeometry() method of cell entities
   * is used to generate shape information for its lower-dimensional
   * sub-entities. Note that any adjacent cell can be used and no selection rule
   * is given.
   *
   * Even cells without shape information may be passed. In this case the
   * current implementation builds a cell with straight edges of type
   * lf::geometry::TriaO1 (in the case of a topological triangle) or
   * lf::geometry::QuadO1 (in the case of a quadrilateral) from the node
   * positions. The shape of edges is not taken into account.
   *
   * An extreme situation is marked by passing node positions as the only
   * geometric information together with topological node-cell incidence
   * relationships. In this case the constructor will build a mesh with straight
   * edges throughout, type lf::geometry::SegmentO1.
   *
   * ### Missing entities
   *
   * @note not all edges of the mesh have to be passed in the `edges` argument;
   *       missing edges are inserted based on the information about the cells.
   *
   * @note the position of node information the `nodes` array and of cell
   *        information in the `cells` array, respectively,
   *        determines the interpretation of the index numbers,
   *        that is the n-th node in the container has index n-1.
