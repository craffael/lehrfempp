/** @brief Relative orientation of a sub-entity
 *
 * Relative orientation is a fundamental topological concept describing the
 * relationship of of an entity and its subentities.
 *
 * For 2D meshes it is mainly relevant for edges: If the intrinsic orientation
 * of an edge defined by the ordering of its vertices agrees with the local
 * orientation of that edge in a cell, its relative orientation is positive,
 * otherwise negative.

/** @brief **Interface class** representing a topological entity in a
 * cellular complex
 *
 * Example: a 2D hybrid mesh consists of cells (entities of co-dimension 0),
 * edges (entities of co-dimension 1), and nodes (entities of co-dimension 2).
 * The set of these entities endowed with _incidence relations_ defines the
 * topology of the mesh.
 *
 * The core purpose of this class is to provide interface definitions for
 * accessing incidence relations and geometry information. This interface
 * applies  to all (topological) types of entities.
 *
 * Further information can be found in @lref{sss:meshtopo} of the
 * [Lecture Document](https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NUMPDEFL/NUMPDE.pdf)
