 * @brief Reads a [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/) `*.msh` file into a

 *
 * In order to import the `*.msh` file successfully make sure that:
 * - Save the mesh in Gmsh's proprietary `*.msh` file format
 *   (`Version 2 ASCII` or `Version 2 Binary`)
 * - If you have specified physical entities in Gmsh and you want to export
 *   them, make sure you don't tick `Save all (ignore physical groups)` and
 *   make sure that every surface (2d) / volume (3d) belongs to at least one
 *   physical entity.
 *   (Otherwise the corresponding mesh elements are not exported by Gmsh)
 * - If you didn't specify any physical entities in Gmsh, you should tick
 *   `Save all (ignore physical groups)`.
 * - The GmshReader doesn't support the options "Save parametric coordinates"
 *   and "Save one file per partition".
 *
 * #### Sample usage:
 * @snippet gmsh_reader.cc usage
 *
 * #### Note about mesh completeness:
 * In principle, Gmsh can export meshes that are not "complete", i.e. meshes
 * containing entities with codim>0 that are not sub-entities of cell-entities.
 * Also, if Gmsh exports a higher-order mesh, it has to introduce
 * "auxilliary nodes" in order to define the higher-order mesh elements (these
 * auxilliary nodes are normally placed on edges, faces or in the interior of
 * cells).
 *
 * Since incomplete meshes are usually not useful in a FEM context, GmshReader
 * doesn't insert into the mesh auxilliary nodes or nodes not belonging to at
 * least one cell. Auxilliary nodes are however used in the construction of
 * higher order geometry objects.
