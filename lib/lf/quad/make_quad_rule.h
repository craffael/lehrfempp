 * Square to the triangle.

 * in the forms of @ref QuadRule objects. They are meant to be
 * used in low-order finite element methods when the quadrature
 * rules can easily fixed a-priori and should feature a special
 * location of quadrature points as is required, e.g., for mass-lumping
 * techniques.
 *
 * For some examples see [Lecture
 * Document](https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NUMPDEFL/NUMPDE.pdf)
 * @lref{ex:triquadrules}.
 *
 * QuadRule objects with a particular order but otherwise unspecified properties
 * can be created by @ref lf::quad::make_QuadRule().
