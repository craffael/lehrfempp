 This tutorial shows you how you can call LehrFEM++ from your own code in a few simple steps.
 We will make a very simple program that calls LehrFEM++ and prints the number of nodes of a triangle to the console.
 
 \note Because LehrFEM++ relies on the [Hunter Package Manager](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter), there is no need to download LehrFEM++ itself!
 
 ### 1. Check Prerequisites
 
 You only need a recent version of [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (>= 3.10) and one of the supported compilers:
 - **Linux:**
   - Clang Version >= 5 (tests run with clang-5.0)
   - GCC Version >= 7 (tests run with g++-7)
 - **OSX:**
   - XCode >= 9.4 (tests run with XCode 9.4)
 - **Windows:**
   - Visual Studio 2017 or later is required (tests run with VS2017), only x64 is supported!
 
 
 ### 2. Create a new CMake project
 1. Create a folder `getting_started` somewhere on your system and create the subfolder `cmake` in it, e.g.
 ```
 > mkdir getting_started
 > cd getting_started
 > mkdir cmake
 ```
 2. Create the empty file `getting_started/main.cc`. Later on, we will add the `main()` function to this file and call LehrFEM++ from there.
 3. Download the [`HunterGate.cmake`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunter-packages/gate/master/cmake/HunterGate.cmake) file into `getting_started/cmake`
 ```
 > cd cmake
 > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunter-packages/gate/master/cmake/HunterGate.cmake
 ```
On Mac OSX use curl instead:
 ```
 > cd cmake
 > curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunter-packages/gate/master/cmake/HunterGate.cmake
 ```
   This file is needed to setup the hunter package manager (which runs completly inside CMake).
 4. Create the file `getting_started/CMakeLists.txt` with the following content
 ```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

### Hunter package manager ###
include("cmake/HunterGate.cmake")
HunterGate(
    URL "https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/archive/v0.23.207.tar.gz"
    SHA1 "6e1b05a1f65c2aa492f7f43a43578e83ac62bbdd"
)

### Setup CMake Project ###
project(GettingStarted)

# download dependencies
hunter_add_package(lehrfempp)
find_package(lehrfempp CONFIG REQUIRED)

# define executable
add_executable(getting_started main.cc)

# link executable with LehrFEM++ module lf::base
target_link_libraries(getting_started LF::lf.base) 
 ```
   Note that this `CMakeLists.txt` links only with the `lf.base` module of LehrFEM++. Because we only want to print the number of nodes of a triangle, it suffices to link to the `lf.base` module.
   However, if you want to use more functionality, you will probably need to link to other LehrFEM++ modules as well.
   See \ref modules_ for more info about LehrFEM++ modules and [__list of namespaces__](./namespaces.html) for a list of all LehrFEM++ modules.

 5. Your folder structure should look as follows:
 ```
 getting_started
 +-- CMakeLists.txt
 +-- main.cc
 +-- cmake
 |   +-- HunterGate.cmake
 ```
 6. Use CMake to create the makefiles for you. Depending on your platform, you have a [few different options](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/). 
   It is strongly suggested that you do an out-of-source build, i.e. that you place your binaries in a folder that is different from `getting_started`.
   E.g. on linux:
 ```
 > cd getting_started
 > mkdir bin
 > cd bin
 > cmake .. 
 ```
   The first time you run CMake, it will take a while because hunter will download all dependencies (LehrFEM++ and its dependencies) and compile them.
   

### 3. Write a program
 Here we will write a very simple program that prints the number of nodes of a triangle to the console. 
 For this we write the following code into the previously created `main.cc`:
 ```
#include <iostream>

// Include the lf::base module
#include <lf/base/base.h>


int main() {
  std::cout << lf::base::RefEl::kTria().NumNodes() << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
 ```
 
 Afterwards compile your program and run it. Example on linux:
 ```
 > cd getting_started/bin
 > make
 > ./getting_started
 ```
 
 
 
### Notes about versioning
The LehrFEM++ team releases new versions of LehrFEM++ on hunter when important changes happen. 
These releases are _tagged_ on github and you can see all releases [here](https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp/releases).

It's important to understand that the concrete `HunterGate` command that you use in your CMakeLists will determine the versions of LehrFEM++ that you can use in your code.
If you want to use the latest version of LehrFEM++, you should also use the [latest `HunterGate` command](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/releases).
Hunter allows you to select the [LehrFEM++ version](https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp/releases) explictly, see [here](https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/wiki/example.custom.config.id).
If you don't specify a version explicitly, the most recent version which is available with your current `HunterGate` command, is used.


### Use a cutting edge version of LehrFEM++
Hunter also allows you to manually use any commit from the [LehrFEM++ github repository](https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp).
This can be useful if you want to use a version of LehrFEM++ that has not yet been officially released via hunter.
We show here how you can use the commit with hash [41fe4560d5f56612059c3f919ec1a83093116984](https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp/commit/41fe4560d5f56612059c3f919ec1a83093116984) in your own project.

1) Determine the SHA1 hash of the commit:
```
wget https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp/archive/41fe4560d5f56612059c3f919ec1a83093116984.tar.gz
openssl sha1 41fe4560d5f56612059c3f919ec1a83093116984.tar.gz
```

2) create the file `cmake/Hunter/config.cmake` in your own project and fill it with the following content (see [here](https://docs.hunter.sh/en/latest/reference/user-modules/hunter_config.html) for more information), adapt it accordingly if you want to use another commit:
```
hunter_config(lehrfempp
  URL "https://github.com/craffael/lehrfempp/archive/41fe4560d5f56612059c3f919ec1a83093116984.tar.gz"
  SHA1 "096b893adecebe22b57fe5677e7edb0887b2cecc"
)
```
3) modify the HunterGate command in your top-level `CMakeLists.txt` so that it includes the local config file:
```
HunterGate(
    URL ...
    SHA1 ...
    LOCAL # use cmake/Hunter/config.cmake
)
```

4) build your project as before. Note that the commit that the build can fail depending on whether the commit you have selected built LehrFEM++ correctly.
