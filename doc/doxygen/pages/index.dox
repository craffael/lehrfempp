/** \mainpage Welcome to LehrFEM++

LehrFEM++ is a simple Finite Element Framework for research and education optimized for
clarity and flexibility with some trade-off concerning performance.

LehrFEM++ has been developed by as code platform for the course "Numerical Methods for
Partial Differential Equations" regularly taught for second-year BSc students at ETH
Zurich. Chapter 2 of the [lecture
notes](https://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/~grsam/NUMPDEFL/NUMPDE.pdf) (work in progress!)
discuss fundamental algorithms for finite element methods and Sections 2.7 and 2.8 even
give details about data structures and algorithms used in LehrFEM++.
