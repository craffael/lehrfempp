# Divergence Conforming Discontinuous Galerkin FEM for the Stokes Problem

This folder contains the code developed in the context of the bachelor thesis *"Divergence Conforming Discontinuous Galerkin FEM for the Stokes Problem"* by Tobias Rohner under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ralf Hiptmair.
The bachelor thesis containing the full derivation of the method implemented is available [here](thesis.pdf).
All the numerical experiments used to investigate the convergence rate and limitations of the algorithm can be found in the folder `experiments`.
