# Nested Cylinders

The experimental setup consists of two concentric cylinders with a fluid in the gap between them. The cylinders are then rotated and the computed velocity field is compared to the analytical solution. A detailed description of the experiment can be found in section 5.6 [here](../../thesis.pdf). The main observation from this experiment is that the function space used to model the vector potential for the flow does not necessarily contain the vector potential of the correct solution when the computational domain is not simply connected.
