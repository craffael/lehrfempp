# Manufactured Solution

This experiment demonstrates that the algorithm is not consistent (The scheme does not converge to the analytical solution) for nonzero volumetric forces present. It does this by constructing an analytically known solution depending on some volumetric forces. A detailed description can be found in section 5.2 [here](../../thesis.pdf). A proof of the inconsistency can be found in proposition 3 section 5.1 in the aforementioned document.
