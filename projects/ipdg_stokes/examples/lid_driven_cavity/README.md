# Lid Driven Cavity

The lid driven cavity experiment consists of a cavity Ω = [0, 1]² where the top lid is diven with a velocity v = 1. A detailed description of the experiment can be found in section 5.3 [here](../../thesis.pdf). An interesting observation from this experiment is the behavoir of the algorithm when confronted with discontinuous dirichlet boundary conditions.
