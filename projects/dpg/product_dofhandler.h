/**
 * @brief Dofhandler for uniform finite element spaces that
 * discretizes a cartesian/product space.
 *
 * This class for indices of global shape functions is suitable
 * for situations where the FE-space is based on a Cartesian Product
 * function space and where every geometric entity of a particular
 * type has exactly the same number of shape functions.
 *
 * ###Additional terminology:
 *
 * - We use the term "product space" or "cartesian space" for function spaces
 * \f$ U \f$ that have the following structure \f[ U = U_0 \times U_1 \times
 * \dots \times U_{n-1} \f] where each of the \f$ U_i \f$ is a  function space
 * of scalar  valued functions.
 *
 * - A function in such a space  represents several variables \f$ u = (u_0,
 * \dots u_{n-1}) \f$. We usually use the term component to refer to such a
 * variable. Each component \f$ u_i \f$ is associated to  a unique component
 * index \f$ i \in \{ 0,\dots n-1 \} \f$ representing its position
 *
 *
 * ###Rules for ordering global shape functions.
 *
 * The following rules are used to order global shape functions in such a
 * product space:
 *
 * - Dofs belonging to components of smaller component index are arranged before
 * dofs belonging to components of larger component index.
 * - Within each component the ususal rules for ordering global shape functions
 * specified in lf::assemble::DofHandler apply.
 *
 * ###Rules for ordering local shape functions.
 *
 * - Dofs belonging to components of smaller component index are
 * arranged before dofs associated to components of larger component index.
 * - Within each component the usual rules for ordering local shape functions
 * specified in lf::assemble::DofHandler apply.
 *
 *
 * These rules result in a block structure of both Element matrices and system
 * matrices.
 *
 * This construction of the dof handler
 * also implicitly defines a basis on the Cartesian space based on the bases
 * on the component spaces in the following way: If the dofhandler manages dofs
 * on the Product space \f$ U_h \times  Q_h \f$ , where \f$U_h\f$ and \f$Q_h\f$
 * have bases \f$\{u_i\}\f$ and \f$\{q_j\}\f$, then the basis on the Cartesian
 * space is given by: \f$\{(u_i,0)\} \cup \{(0,q_j)\} \f$, as one would expect.
