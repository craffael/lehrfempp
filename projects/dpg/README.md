# DPG Methods for the Convection-Diffusion Problem

This folder contains the code developed for the bachelor thesis ["Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin Methods for the Convection-Diffusion Problem"] (http://www.sam.math.ethz.ch/%7Ehiptmair/StudentProjects/Peter.Philippe/BScThesis.pdf) by Philippe Peter under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Ralf Hiptmair. Both the primal and ultraweak DPG formulations of the 2D convection-diffusion problem were implemented for hybrid meshes. All numerical experiments that investigate the convergence rates of the two methods can be found in the folder 'convergence_studies'
