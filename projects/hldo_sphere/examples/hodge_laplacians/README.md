# Poiseuille

This experiment computes the Poiseuille velocity profile between two infinitely extending parallel plates with a constant pressure gradient between them. As the numerical scheme is not consistent (section 5.1 proposition 3 [here](../../thesis.pdf)) this can be used to verify the underlying code. A detailed description of the experiment can be found in section 5.4 [here](../../thesis.pdf).
