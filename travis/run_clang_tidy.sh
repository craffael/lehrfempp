# This script is called from .travis.yml
#
# It takes two inputs as environment variables:
#   COMPILER specifies the compiler to use (e.g. g++-7)
#   BUILD_TYPE specifies the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.
# 
# Also it takes exactly one command line parameter which is a regex expression
# that specifies the files to include (see .travis.yml for example)
# It builds and tests Lehrfempp using the provided compiler + cmake configuration.

# Exit immediately from this script upon error
